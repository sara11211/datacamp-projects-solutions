In this project, we are going to explore a key development in the history of Lego: the introduction of licensed sets such as Star Wars, Super Heroes, and Harry Potter.\n","\n","The introduction of its first licensed series, Star Wars, was a hit that sparked a series of collaborations with more themed sets. The partnerships team has asked you to perform an analysis of this success, and before diving into the analysis, they have suggested reading the descriptions of the two datasets to use, reported below.\n","\n","## The Data\n","\n","You have been provided with two datasets to use.
